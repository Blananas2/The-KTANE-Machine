# The KTANE Machine
A JavaScript solver for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (mods included).

The KTANE Machine is Blananas2’s attempt at coding something that can solve Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes bombs. If you are unfamiliar with Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, please play the game first.

Solvers for modded modules are also included, if you are unfamiliar with modded modules, you can find their manuals on: https://ktane.timwi.de/

Disclaimers: 
The code for these solvers may be messy and/or inefficient, I’m not a good programmer and I never claim to be, this is just for fun.
Also, this is my first Github repo, as such, some things may not make much sense.

New solvers for modules will be created in the order they were released.

These solvers use `console.log();` in Javascript to give answers. So if your IDE can use it, than you can insert code into there. Alternatively, you can use https://tio.run/# and put the code into there.

**How to use the bot:**
- Find the text file named after the module you would like to solve.
- Copy the entire code in the text file into your IDE of choice (or tio.run).
- Only change the variables at the very top of the code _before_ the 1st single line gap.
- Run the code for the answer to be placed into the console.

**For those who want to edit the code:**

If you want to improve the code, go ahead but don’t submit it to me unless there’s a bug. In that case, tell me where the bug is.
I’ve given all modules a 3-letter prefix so one module’s code doesn’t affect another, thus, making a solver for multiple modules is possible if desired.
